## Instructions

Reflection is a key activity of learning. It helps you build a strong metacognition, or "understanding of your own learning." A good learner not only "knows what they know", but they "know what they don't know", too. Learning to reflect takes practice, but if your goal is to become a self-directed learner where you can teach yourself things, reflection is imperative.

- Now that you've completed the assignment, share your throughts. What did you learn? What confuses you? Where did you struggle? Where might you need more practice?
- A good reflection is: **specific as possible**,  **uses the terminology of the problem domain** (what was learned in class / through readings), and **is actionable** (you can pursue next steps, or be aided in the pursuit). That last part is what will make you a self-directed learner.
- Flex your recall muscles. You might have to review class notes / assigned readings to write your reflection and get the terminology correct.
- Your reflection is for **you**. Yes I make you write them and I read them, but you are merely practicing to become a better self-directed learner. If you read your reflection 1 week later, does what you wrote advance your learning?

Examples:

- **Poor Reflection:**  "I don't understand loops."   
**Better Reflection:** "I don't undersand how the while loop exits."   
**Best Reflection:** "I struggle writing the proper exit conditions on a while loop." It's actionable: You can practice this, google it, ask Chat GPT to explain it, etc. 
-  **Poor Reflection** "I learned loops."   
**Better Reflection** "I learned how to write while loops and their difference from for loops."   
**Best Reflection** "I learned when to use while vs for loops. While loops are for sentiel-controlled values (waiting for a condition to occur), vs for loops are for iterating over collections of fixed values."

# This assignment was tough for me. Even though the final tests showed a pass, I know my code didn't completely work right. When I ran the individual tests, some of them failed with errors, which was frustrating. I think I got the basic structure of the pipeline working - the three steps that pass data from one part to the next - but some of the details didn't work properly.

# The API calls were especially tricky. Sometimes they worked, but other times they would fail or give me data I didn't expect. I tried using the debugging tips like adding print statements and checking values at each step, but I still couldn't fix all the problems. The part where we had to extract important words from the reviews was particularly confusing - my code would run but wouldn't always find all the words it should have.

# I'm not sure why the overall test passed when some parts clearly didn't work. Maybe the grading system was only checking certain things? I wish I had more time to figure out why those tests were failing. The automatic grading was helpful but also a bit confusing since it didn't match what I was seeing when I ran the tests myself.

# Even though I struggled, I did learn some important things about working with APIs and building multi-step systems. Next time, I'll start earlier so I have more time to fix errors, and I'll ask for help when I get stuck instead of waiting until the last minute.
